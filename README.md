## Challenge altudo

>> Here are the requirements for the development exercise that we will need you to complete. Treat this as a mini-project, and don’t hesitate to ask any questions: 
>>> Create an application that would accept a web URL and display all of the images used on the page and create a graph or table with the top 10 used words. 
>>>> There is no requirement on the technology or tools to be used for that; this part is up to you 
>>>>> Feel free to ask me (the person conducting the first interview and sending this email) whatever and however many questions over email to help you create the solution 
>>>>>> Once the solution is created, please share the source code and the installation package with instructions on using it.  
>>>>>>> Once you’ve understood the scope, please provide a completion date for this exercise.

#### Models(Integrate)
> It houses the Project's Model Classes (Entities)

#### Help(StringHelper)
> Support Classes for performing specific tasks

#### Html Agility Pack(Package)
> This is an agile HTML parser that builds a read/write DOM and supports plain XPATH or XSLT (you actually don't HAVE to understand XPATH nor XSLT to use it, don't worry...). It is a .NET code library that allows you to parse "out of the web" HTML files. The parser is very tolerant with "real world" malformed HTML. The object model is very similar to what proposes System.Xml, but for HTML documents (or streams).

#### ConsoleTables(Package)
> Allows you to print out objects in a table view in a console application. Should be helpful for the diehard console fans..


### Running the Project
> The user must choose one of the options according to the screen
